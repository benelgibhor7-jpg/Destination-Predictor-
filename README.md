# Destination Predictor

## 🚀 About This Project
A Python-based travel time calculator that predicts arrival times based on distance, speed, and current time. Built as part of my journey to become an astronaut and study robotics at MIT.

## 💡 What It Does
- Calculates travel time based on distance and speed
- Validates all user inputs with error handling
- Uses Python's datetime library for accurate time calculations
- Provides user-friendly error messages

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- datetime library
- Input validation with try/except
- While loops for user interaction

## 📚 What I Learned
- DateTime manipulation in Python
- Input validation and error handling
- While loops with break conditions
- Working with timedelta for time arithmetic
- Debugging for 6 hours straight without giving up!

## 🎯 Development Stats
- **Time invested:** 6 hours (including debugging)
- **Lines of code:** ~50
- **Errors overcome:** Indentation errors, syntax errors, validation logic
- **My age:** 17 years old
- **Date:** December 2025

## 🚧 Future Improvements (v2.0)
- [ ] Multiple transportation modes (car, train, plane, walk)
- [ ] Traffic delay predictions
- [ ] Weather delay integration
- [ ] Fuel cost calculations
- [ ] Multi-stop trip planning

## 👨‍🚀 About Me
I'm a 17-year-old aspiring astronaut learning programming and robotics from scratch on my phone. This is part of my 6-month journey to build a portfolio for university applications.

**Goal:** MIT → Mechatronics → Aerospace Engineering → NASA → Space 🚀
